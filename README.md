## Developerless vision
we are uncovering a better way of developing software, more ethical. This work has come to value:

- **the autonomy of the software** over dependency by the developer
- **the needs of users** over the technical limitation
- **the business opportunity** over the technical opportunity
- **the result and the team** over the personal ego
- **the software development** over the daily maintenance

That is, even if it could be value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left.

## Developerless principles
We follow these principles:

1. I don't want to be the bottleneck.
2. I don't want to be essential
3. Be the bottleneck and essential is not the way to preserve my work. Bringing value will bring more value.
4. There is no value that a developer can add doing  repetitive tasks when a machine can do for you
5. There is no value doing a manual when it can be automated
6. Our purpose is to create new software, not being crushed under old software maintenance
7. The software must be reusable
8. taking from the community must be ethical. You have to give back what you take.
